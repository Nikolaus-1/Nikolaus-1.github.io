      <p>These are just a few of the many alumni that we found however, during the performance we
      did end up with some problems that could have been fixed like</p>
     
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Not enough water</li>
        <li>Broken stands</li>
        <li>Lack of music</li>
        <li>Moving soccer net</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p> These were just some of the problems during the performance, however, even with all these
      problems we still managed to last throughout the performance. We also ended on a good note
      and our team won the game.</p>
