  <h1>Ovid-Elsie Marching Band Allows Alumni to Showcase Their Talents </h1>
  <h3>When is This Event Supposed to Take Place?</h3>
  <p>The Marching Band will be held at Ovid-Elsie High School on the field 
    from 6:00 to 8:00 on Friday, Sep 20th.
    The band will be a mix of all grade levels, along with all graduates 
    Who will be in attendance at this event?</p>
  <h3>What the 8th Graders/Alumni will Expect</h3>
  <p>This will be the first time Alumni will join the 8th graders for 
    a performance. In preparation for this event, we questioned 
    <b>Stacy James</b> 
    about what she thought of the outcome of the    
    performance, 
    <q>I believe the 8th grade will do fine during the performance, however, 
      I am worried about whether we have enough Alumni for this event.</q> </p>
  <h3>The Current Fear for The Band</h3>
  <p>The worry at this current time is the possibility that there may be 
    too few Alumni for this performance to take place during the time from 
    now till Sep 20th, 2024. This may contain a chance that the performance 
    doesn't go as planned and is either postponed or canceled, because of the 
    few Alumni in attendance.</p>
